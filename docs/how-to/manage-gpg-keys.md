# Manage GPG keys

The Hockeypuck charm provides both Juju actions and HTTP APIs for managing OpenPGP keys stored on the keyserver.

## Juju actions
The charm provides two main actions for database management: `block-keys` and `lookup-key`.

The `block-keys` action allows you to remove public keys from the keyserver and prevent them from being re-imported via reconciliation. This is useful for managing compromised or spam-related keys.
```bash
juju run hockeypuck-k8s/0 block-keys fingerprints=2CF6A6A3B93C138FD51037564415DC328A6C8E00,7EG5A6A3B93C138FD51037568415DC326A6C8F01 comment=R123
```
This command ensures that the public keys associated with the fingerprints `2CF6A6A3B93C138FD51037564415DC328A6C8E00` and `7EG5A6A3B93C138FD51037568415DC326A6C8F01` are deleted from the keyserver and added to Hockeypuck's [blocklist](https://hockeypuck.io/configuration.html#:~:text=the%20OpenPGP%20engine-,blacklist,-contains%20a%20list) to prevent the keys from being reconciled again.

The `lookup-key` action allows you to check if a key associated with the fingerprint is present in the keyserver:
```
juju run hockeypuck-k8s/0 lookup-key keyword=0x2CF6A6A3B93C138FD51037564415DC328A6C8E00
```

[note]
* Use `0x` prefix only for `lookup-key`.
* Do not use `0x` prefix when specifying fingerprints in `block-keys`.

## Hockeypuck APIs

The Hockeypuck server also provides a set of SKS-compatible endpoints for interacting with the keyserver over HTTP.

### `/pks/lookup`
**Purpose:**
Retrieve key information by fingerprint, name, or email.

**Query Parameters:**
- op: The operation type, e.g., get, vindex, or index.
- search: The search term (e.g., key ID, fingerprint, email, or name).
- fingerprint: Optional. If on, returns full fingerprints instead of short key IDs.

**Example:**
```bash
curl "http://$HOCKEYPUCK_ADDRESS/pks/lookup?op=get&search=$FINGERPRINT&fingerprint=on"
```

### `/pks/add`
**Purpose:**
Add a new public key to the keyserver.

**Example:**
```bash
# store the public key of admin in a file
gpg --armor --export $ADMIN_FINGERPRINT > public_key.asc

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --data-urlencode "keytext=$(cat public_key.asc)" http://$HOCKEYPUCK_URL/pks/add
```

### `/pks/replace`
**Purpose:**
Replace an existing public key on the keyserver with a new one.

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --data-urlencode "keytext=$(cat request.txt)" --data-urlencode "keysig=$(cat signature.asc)" http://$HOCKEYPUCK_URL/pks/replace
```
Refer to the [Hockeypuck Server Administration](https://hockeypuck.io/admin.html) for more information on how to generate the signature and the request.

### `/pks/delete`
**Purpose:**
Delete a public key from the keyserver.

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --data-urlencode "keytext=$(cat request.txt)" --data-urlencode "keysig=$(cat signature.asc)" http://$HOCKEYPUCK_URL/pks/delete
```

Refer to the [Hockeypuck Server Administration](https://hockeypuck.io/admin.html) for more information on how to generate the signature and the request.
