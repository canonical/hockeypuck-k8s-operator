# Charm architecture

At its core, [Hockeypuck](https://hockeypuck.io/) is a [Go](https://go.dev/) application that integrates with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/). The [Hockeypuck charm](https://github.com/canonical/hockeypuck-k8s-operator) was developed using the [12-factor Go framework](https://canonical-charmcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/stable/reference/extensions/go-framework-extension/). This framework allows us to easily deploy and operate Hockeypuck with associated infrastructure, such as databases and ingress.

## Charm architecture diagram

Below is a diagram of the application architecture of the hockeypuck-k8s charm.

C4Container

System_Boundary(hockeypuckcharm, "Hockeypuck Charm") {

    Container_Boundary(hockeypuck_container, "Hockeypuck Workload Container") {
        Component(hockeypuck_core, "Hockeypuck", "Go Application", "Observes events, serves web requests")
    }

    Container_Boundary(charm_container, "Charm Container") {
        Component(charm_logic, "Charm Logic", "Juju Operator Framework", "Controls application deployment & config")
    }
}

```

The charm design leverages the [sidecar](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2015/06/the-distributed-system-toolkit-patterns/#example-1-sidecar-containers) pattern to allow multiple containers in each pod with [Pebble](https://ops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pebble.html) running as the workload containerâ€™s entrypoint.

Pebble is a lightweight, API-driven process supervisor that is responsible for configuring processes to run in a container and controlling those processes throughout the workload lifecycle.

Pebble `services` are configured through [layers](https://github.com/canonical/pebble#layer-specification), and the following container represents one layer forming the effective Pebble configuration, or `plan`:

1. The [Hockeypuck](https://hockeypuck.io/) container itself, which has a webserver configured in HTTP mode.

As a result, if you run a `kubectl get pods` on a namespace named for the Juju model you've deployed the Hockeypuck charm into, you'll see something like the following:

```bash
NAME                                    READY    STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hockeypuck-k8s-0                         2/2     Running   0         6h4m
```

This shows there are 2 containers - the one named above, as well as a container for the charm code itself.

And if you run `kubectl describe pod hockeypuck-k8s-0`, all the containers will have a command ```/charm/bin/pebble```. That's because Pebble is responsible for the processes' startup as explained above. 

## OCI images

We use [Rockcraft](https://canonical-rockcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/) to build the OCI image for the hockeypuck-k8s charm. 
The image is defined in [hockeypuck-k8s rock](https://github.com/canonical/hockeypuck-k8s-operator/blob/main/hockeypuck_rock/rockcraft.yaml).
They are published to [Charmhub](https://charmhub.io/), the official repository of charms.

## Containers

The workload that this container is running is defined in the [hockeypuck-k8s rock](https://github.com/canonical/hockeypuck-k8s-operator/blob/main/hockeypuck_rock/rockcraft.yaml). Hockeypuck reads the [hockeypuck.conf](https://github.com/canonical/hockeypuck-k8s-operator/blob/main/hockeypuck_rock/hockeypuck.conf) configuration file during startup.

## Metrics

The following metrics are provided by the workload container at the `/metrics` endpoint at port 9626:

### Server metrics

* **hockeypuck_keys_added**: Number of new keys added since startup.
* **hockeypuck_keys_added_jitter**: Number of lost PTree (Probabilistic Tree) entries recreated.
* **hockeypuck_keys_ignored**: Number of keys with no-op (unchanged) updates.
* **hockeypuck_keys_removed**: Number of keys removed since startup.
* **hockeypuck_keys_removed_jitter**: Number of stale PTree entries cleaned up.
* **hockeypuck_keys_updated**: Number of keys that have been updated.
* **hockeypuck_http_request_duration_seconds**: Time spent generating HTTP responses.

### Reconciliation metrics

* **conflux_reconciliation_items_recovered**: Count of items recovered since startup
* **conflux_reconciliation_busy_peer**: Count of reconciliations attempted against busy peers since startup
* **conflux_reconciliation_duration_seconds**: Time spent performing a reconciliation, in seconds
* **conflux_reconciliation_event_time_seconds**: When the given event last occurred, in seconds since the epoch
* **conflux_reconciliation_failure**: Count of failed reconciliations since startup
* **conflux_reconciliation_success**: Count of successful reconciliations since startup

Apart from these, there are [Go runtime metrics](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/metrics) and process-level metrics also available.
 
## Juju events

For this charm, the following Juju events are observed:

1. [app_pebble_ready](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/hook/index.html#container-pebble-ready): fired on Kubernetes charms when the requested container is ready. **Action**: validate the charm configuration, run pending migrations and restart the workload.

## Charm code overview

The `src/charm.py` is the default entry point for a charm and has the `HockeypuckK8SCharm` Python class that inherits from `PaasCharm`, which internally uses `CharmBase`. `CharmBase` is the base class from which all charms are formed, defined by [Ops](https://ops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Python framework for developing charms).

> See more in the Juju docs: [Charm](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/latest/reference/charm/)

The `__init__` method guarantees that the charm observes all events relevant to its operation and handles them.

Take, for example, when a configuration is changed by using the CLI.

1. User runs the configuration command:
```bash
juju config hockeypuck-k8s app-port=8000
```
2. A `config-changed` event is emitted.
3. In the `__init__` method is defined how to handle this event like this:
```python
self.framework.observe(self.on.config_changed, self._on_config_changed)
```
4. The method `_on_config_changed`, for its turn, will take the necessary actions such as waiting for all the relations to be ready and then configuring the containers.
