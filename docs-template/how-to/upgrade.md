# Upgrade Hockeypuck

Before updating the charm you need to back up the database using the PostgreSQL charmâ€™s create-backup action.

```bash
juju run postgresql-k8s/leader create-backup
```

Additional information can be found about backing up in the [PostgreSQL charm's documentation](https://charmhub.io/postgresql-k8s/docs/h-configure-s3-aws).

Then you can upgrade the Hockeypuck charm:

```bash
juju refresh hockeypuck-k8s
```
After upgrading the Hockeypuck charm you need to rebuild the prefix tree:

```bash
juju run hockeypuck-k8s/0 rebuild-prefix-tree
```
